## Vim Config

This is my personal vim configuration, which I use for my work, and personal projects

### Prerequisites

#### Vundle

This is an awesome package manager for vim plugins.

All of the packages configured here managed by [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git)

    git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

#### All Plugins are creations of awesome devs, please go to their git account and have a look.

After cloning Vundle

```
vim

:PackageInstall

```
